Current issues with the code :

1. Getting product_quantity is not perfect. It sometimes work and most of the time doesn't.
2. In the case of having two options such as 64 GB / 128 GB, the program does not update, but a potential fix is the class tag updates to class="xxxx-selected"
3. Other potential issues I overlooked.
